# Movie Recommendation System

In this project, I've developed a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens 25M dataset, which includes millions of user ratings and reviews. The system allows users to input a movie title and receive recommendations for other movies they might enjoy. The project utilizes natural language processing techniques, specifically TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, to compare and recommend movies based on their titles. Additionally, it employs user-based collaborative filtering to recommend movies liked by users with similar tastes.

**Key Features:**

- Data Cleaning: Preprocessed movie titles to remove special characters.
- Search Functionality: Implemented a search engine using TF-IDF and cosine similarity to find movies by title.
- Collaborative Filtering: Recommended movies based on user ratings and preferences, using user-based collaborative filtering.
- Interactive Interface: Created an interactive Jupyter Notebook interface for users to input movie titles and receive recommendations.

**Technologies Used:**

- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- ipywidgets
- Jupyter Notebook
